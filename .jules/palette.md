## 2024-05-14 - Data Loss Prevention & Dark Mode Contrast

**Learning:**
1. Dynamically added form elements in multi-step flows are prone to accidental clicks leading to complete data loss for that section.
2. Standard "grey" shades like `#666` used for secondary text in dark mode (background `#1a1a1a` or `#0f0f0f`) often fail WCAG AA contrast ratio requirements (4.5:1), making them inaccessible to users with low vision.

**Action:**
1. Always add a confirmation step (e.g., `confirm()`) before removing dynamically generated form segments if they contain user-entered data.
2. Use lighter greys like `#9ca3af` for secondary text against dark backgrounds to ensure adequate contrast.
